# Creature-Creator
Procedurally generate creatures in Unity. Inspired by Spore.

In short, the creator is divided into three sections: building, painting and testing. Building lets you mold your creature's body, and attach different body parts to it, and painting lets you change the colour and pattern of your creature’s skin!

# How It Was Made:

# How To Play:
* **Camera** - Drag your mouse to rotate the camera around your creature and scroll to zoom in and out! 
* **Body** - The body is manipulated using the spine, which you are able to move around (by dragging) and add/remove weight to (by using the scroll-wheel)!
* **Body Parts** - Drag different body parts from the grid and attach them to your creature's body. Body parts each have different statistics, that increase the creature’s overall statistics when added! 
* **Paint** - Patterns are selected from the patterns grid, and a primary and secondary colour are chosen which replace the white and black of patterns respectively.
