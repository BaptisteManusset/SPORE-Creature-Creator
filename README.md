# Creature-Creator
Procedurally generate creatures in Unity. Inspired by SPORE.

In short, the creator is divided into three sections: building, painting and testing. Building lets you mold your creature's body, and attach different body parts to it, and painting lets you change the colour and pattern of your creatureâ€™s skin!
